            <p>Fashion is important because it allows people to express their identity, culture, and creativity without
                saying a word. The way we dress can reflect our personality, mood, values, and even our goals. Beyond
                self-expression, fashion also plays a social and economic role, influencing trends, industries, and
                communities around the world. It builds confidence, creates first impressions, and helps people feel
                comfortable and empowered in their own skin.

        <h3>What is normal flow in HTML?</h2>
            <p>Normal flow is the default way elements are arranged on a webpage.</p>
            <h3>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h3>
            <p>The float property moves an element to the left or right of its container, allowing text or other inline
                elements to wrap around it.</p>
            <h3>OPTIONAL++What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h3>
            <p>When you float an element, it is taken out of normal flow.</p>
            <h3>OPTIONAL++How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h3>
            <p>These are values of the position property.</p>
            <h3>I HOPE YOU KNOW!!++Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h3>
            <p>Good mobile nav buttons should be: Large enough to tap (at least 44px tall),Have padding, Use high
                contrast colors,Stack vertically,Use flexbox for clean layout</p>
